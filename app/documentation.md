The task was:
- Create markup using BEM and preprocessor
- Note: form must be centered by vertical and horizontal

- I used BEM partly because this task wasn't very complicated.
It was no need to use BEM tools and set up a server for simple login form presentation. YAGNI rules.

- Borders of the form.
It's a poor chance that designer painted a form with such paddings. It was even bigger than my screen! I had two options: it is <body> background color or this is still the form element. I leaved background partly. In any case it's easy to fix. However, BEM philosophy means to feel free to exchange components. It's scary to imagine that anyone need such huge form.

- Some work needs to be done both with designer. For example, font-weight or paddings. I could not measure them exactly.
